============
Requirements
============

Fluo depends on the following packages:

  1. django http://www.djangoproject.com (see below for patches required)
  2. sphinx (help & docs)
  3. python-pygments (at least version 0.8.1). Required just to colorize code in the documentation section.

Django
======

Fluo uses django trunk version.

Python
======

Although I try to write with 2.4 in mind, I use esclusively python 2.5 and python 2.6.
