Welcome to Fluo's documentation!
================================

This is the main documentation of `Fluo framework`. Keep in mind that
what is undocumented must be considered highly unstable, so can be changed
without warning.

What is ``Fluo``?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fluo is a set of Django extensions and applications, build on top of Django,
and sometimes overrides Django itself (to patch some bugs, to have a
different behaviour, etc).
